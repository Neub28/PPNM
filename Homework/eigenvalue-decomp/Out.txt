Task A: Jacobi diagonlization with cyclic sweeps
------------------------------------------------
Is V^T A V = D ? True
Is V D V^T = A ? True
Is V^T V = 1 ? True
Is V V^T = 1 ? True
I am now testing the reliability of the optimized routine....
Is V^T A V = D ? True
Is V D V^T = A ? True
Is V^T V = 1 ? True
Is V V^T = 1 ? True
Hydrogen atom, s-wave radial Schrödinger equation of a grid
-----------------------------------------------------------
A plot of the lowest eigenvalues for varying rmax and Δr is in convergence.svg
From this plot we see that for around rmax = 10 and dr = 0.2 the 
eigenvalue convergences to the exact solution.
In swavefunction.svg I have plotted the wavefunctions for lowest energies 
and different n's and compared them to the analytical results.
Part C: Scaling and optimization
-----------------------------------------------------------
First task was to do convergence calculations in parallel.
In my Makefile I use a forloop over different values, therefore 
simply using parallel batch processing '&' at end of each forloop solves this.
