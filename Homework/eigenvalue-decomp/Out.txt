Hydrogen atom, s-wave radial Schrödinger equation of a grid
-----------------------------------------------------------
A plot of the lowest eigenvalues for varying rmax and Δr is in convergence.svg
From this plot we see that for around rmax = 10 and dr = 0.2 the 
eigenvalue convergences to the exact solution.
In swavefunction.svg I have plotted the wavefunctions for lowest energies 
and different n's and compared them to the analytical results.
