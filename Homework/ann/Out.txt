-------------- PART C ------------------
I have implemented a the neural network, which can approximate a 
solution to a differential equation by unsupervised training.
Since the harmonic oscillator is fairly simple and well-known
I will test it with such an equation.
So: φ(t)'' = -φ(t) with φ(0)=1 and φ'(0)=0
