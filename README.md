Repository for the course: "*Practical programming & numerical methods*" at Aarhus University in the spring 2023.

The repository consists of three main folders: 

***exam***        ***homeworks***        ***exercises***

The answers to all of these are found in seperate folders with corresponding names. Each of these has an Out.txt containing some or all of the answers. 
All answers are made such that a *make clean* and *make* can be run.
